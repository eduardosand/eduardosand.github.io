<h1>Eduardo Sandoval</h1>
<p>This site is under construction. I am a PhD candidate at the University of California, Berkeley in Neuroscience. I am generally interested in the application of statistical mechanics to experimental neuroscience. I work primarily with human neuroscience data and simulated data. In my free time, I like to cook, garden, and run to the Berkeley Marina at sunset.</p>
